> Written source code from watching *JavaScript DOM Manipulation Course* by @freeCodeCamp

[The course](https://youtu.be/5fb2aPlgoys "JavaScript DOM Manipulation Course") I took didn't offer its source code for me to work on, so...

I went and did it myself! &ensp;&ensp;:)

***Hope it aids whoever sees this!***
